    (The sqrt function) Write a program that prints the following table
    using your knowledge of loops and the sqrt function in the math module.
    Make sure your table is neat by using print formatting methods we've learned. 
â€‹
        Number  Square Root
        0       0.0000
        1       1.0000
        2       1.4142
