        Latin       English
        sinister    left
        dexter      right

3. Miles Per Gallon Calculator
    Write a GUI program that calculates a car’s gas mileage. The program’s window should
    have Entry widgets that let the user enter the number of gallons of gas the car holds, and
    the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank. When a Calculate MPG button is
    clicked, the program should display the number of miles that the car may be driven per gallon of 
    gas. Use the following formula to calculate miles-per-gallon:
​
        MPG = miles/gallons
​
4. Celsius to Fahrenheit
    Write a GUI program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The user
    should be able to enter a Celsius temperature, click a button, and then see the equivalent
    Fahrenheit temperature. Use the following formula to make the conversion:
​
        F = (9/5)C + 32
​
    F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.
​
5. Property Tax
    A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent
    of the property’s actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value
    is $6,000. The property tax is then $0.64 for each $100 of the assessment value. The tax
    for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $38.40. Write a GUI program that displays the
    assessment value and property tax when a user enters the actual value of a property.
